Hello! 

This repository is designed to keep track of all the different macros I use or have used at different points for reference! Feel free to use these as you see fit or recommend to me any that should/could be added so that other resto druids can be successful!

Also, please keep in mind that not all of these macros are "perfectly optimal," but I've found that many are an incredible help to simplify gameplay enough to help me achieve the results I am looking for.

Enjoy,
