-- Regrowth + swipe + Nature's Vigil on CD
explanation: 
    1. no target -> Regrowth
    2. mouseover ally -> Regrowth and pop Vigil (assumes you are going to be spamming so getting on CD can be good - not as optimal as manual use though)
    3. enemy target (no mouseover) -> shift to cat and swipe, will hold vigil until healing a mouseover
    I recommend testing this one for a bit so you get a feel for it, I really like this to automate aspects of gameplay
